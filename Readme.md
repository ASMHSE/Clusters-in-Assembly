Some weeks ago I found the article: [Comparing K-Means and Others Algorithms for Data Clustering](https://www.codeproject.com/Articles/5375470/Comparing-K-Means-and-Others-Algorithms-for-Data-C) by Nicol√°s Descartes. With C# source code.

Look very interesting to translate that to Assembly. Still is a work in progress but look well.

There is some kind of abuse of Collections, because is very easy to write that in C#. I removed most obvious exagerations (perhaps author try to make more clear the algorithm, not sure).

- K-Means strategy need initial randomness, then probably you have to run several times before to find the better solution.

- Hierarchical strategy need to define termination, and in these cases are number of clusters.

- Density-based spatial clustering of applications with noise really benefit from Collections, and also need a couple of Sorted Vectors.

Anyway is a good challenge, and still I have to collect some leaks
